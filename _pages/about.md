My Name is Sebastian Rizzo, at the time of writing this I am 17 years old and participated in my highschool's duel enrollment program for my senior year in the CSIT Program at ITECH. My highschool is Palmetto Ridge Highschool and I have an average gpa of 3.7. I am from Boston, and moved to florida back in 2023. I enrolled in this class because I've always found technology around me, though my absolute dream jobs may not be entirely related to the field. My professional goals are to get a good few certifications and lisences, and then secure a sustainable, enjoyable job that I can tolerate while also enjoying my life outside of work. Whether that job be related to my classes or not is unkown, but I believe my knowledge could possibly help, even though AI is becoming stronger with each day.
